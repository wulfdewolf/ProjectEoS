This project was made in the context of the Evolution of Speech course, given by Prof. Dr. Bart de Boer at the [VUB](https://www.vub.be/).

## Building

The binary can be built using the makefile:

```console
make
```

## Cleaning

The binary and object files can be cleaned using the makefile:

```console
make clean
```

## Usage

The `main.cpp` file contains code to run simulations. Switching between a fully connected network and a scale-free network can easily be done by changing the type of the defined network.
